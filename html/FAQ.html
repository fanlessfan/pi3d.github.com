<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">My RPi Crashes or reboots when I try and run a demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Anything using a loadable texture (i.e. nearly all the demos) requires
the Python Imaging module, some demos need tk, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com/html/index.html">ReadMe</a> on installing
these.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I see nothing but a White screen:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Possibly something has gone wrong with an opengles function, sometimes
there might be an error message in the terminal such as failed to create
display. This could be caused by running out of gpu memory (see <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com/html/index.html">ReadMe</a>
for how to set up memory split) occasionally multi-thread applications
an cause this problem if an opengles function call is made not from the
main thread.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I see nothing but a black screen:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Possibly something has gone wrong in a shader. There may be a line
nunber reference output by the shader compiler in the terminal window.
It is great fun experimenting with shaders but they are <em>?£#%</em> taciturn
beasts to debug! The problem could be caused by sending some bad
render setting to a shader.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I see nothing but the background (you will need to set background to
non-transparent and a color not equal to black to white to determine
if this is happening):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Either the shape is behind the near plane, beyond the far plane, is outside
the field of view or the polygons are facing away from the camera. Often
this is because you are actually <strong>inside</strong> the object. Try using the
Camera.point_at([x,y,z]) function (see demos/ClashWalk.py for use) or move
and rotate the object. Sprite and ImageSprite shapes are one sided so
cannot be seen from behind, try using a Plane instead</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I can just see black silhouettes against the background:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You may be trying to use a shader that requires light but there isn&#8217;t
any, or it&#8217;s turned down too low. Try switching to a &#8216;flat&#8217; shader
to check. Alternatively, if it&#8217;s a shape you have generated such as
a Lathe or a Model, the normal vectors might be pointing in the wrong
direction. Try re-generating the shape, the path you use for the Lathe
needs to start at the top of the object and there are functions in
most 3D modeling applications to recalculate normals, or force them
to point outwards.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The demo loads but the mouse doesn&#8217;t move the camera as it&#8217;s supposed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If this only happens on demos using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">event</span></tt> library (such as Silo.py)
then it could be the hardware configuration is pretending to be something
it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not uncommon for keyboards to say they are mice or joysticks.
If you have a mouse combined with a keyboard (to save on USB slots) then
you might need to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_mouse_movements(1)</span></tt>. If you have problems
with a device or inputs using the event system it&#8217;s a good idea to run
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">FindDevices.py</span></tt> from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pi3d/event/</span></tt> this will give you lots
of additional information.
TODO - other specific fixes</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I use a joystick, gamepad, xbox controller etc with a pi3d
application:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Often these will just work when plugged into the USB
sometimes you may need to use a different InputEvents method, for instance
with an xbox 360 you get the left joystick from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_joystickB3d()</span></tt>
Also you would need to install the driver and start it running first:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>sudo apt-get install xboxdrv
sudo xboxdrv -s -i 0</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I make my own 3D model to load into pi3d:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You will need to &#8216;make&#8217; one on a bigger computer using 3D software such
as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blender</span></tt>. This falls outside the scope of this FAQ but your best
option is to export the model as an obj file. In the options you should
make sure that you specify normals to be saved. If you want your 3D model
to be textured (have a picture wrapped around it) you will need to
define uv mapping. In programs such as blender it is also possible to
use a more detailed (high polygon) model to create a &#8216;normal map&#8217; image
that can be used to give surface detail to the model in pi3d. Quite
technical but lots of instructional videos on youtube!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I get error messages trying to install from PiStore:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There was an issue with the early versions of PiStore which should
be fixed if you update it. If you continue to have problems and you
are somehow able to read this FAQ somewhere else you should be able
to download a zipped file from <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com">http://pi3d.github.com</a> There is also
documentation and installation instructions on that webiste.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Can I use pi3d for 2D images:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are various ways of doing this. The easiest way is to use the
image to texture a simple rectangle. The simplest shape to do this
is the Sprite which is also utilised by the ImageSprite shape to
allow the texture to be specified as it is created. The Plane object
is similar but is two sided. The advantage and disadvantage of this
method is that images will be different when viewed from different
locations.</p>
<p>If you specify an orthogrphic camera (set the argument
is_3d=False) then there will be no perspective (the image will not
get smaller as it moves away from the camera) and each unit of the
dimensions of the object will be one pixel on the screen. With both
these methods the shape can be rotated, moved and scaled in all
dimensions.</p>
<p>You can also use the shader 2d_flat which takes pixels from an image
and maps them to the screen, see below. The advantage of this
method is that it can use the even simpler Canvas object and</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I display 2D images in front of a 3D scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Either draw them onto a Canvas object using the 2d_flat shader or
create two cameras one 3D and one 2D and assign the relevant camera
to the types of objects you want to be drawn by each method. You
can move the 3D camera around the scene but leave the 2D one stationary,
that way you won&#8217;t have to keep moving and rotating the 2D objects
to keep them in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Orthographic (2D) cameras will render objects so they are in front
of objects rendered by perspective (3D) cameras.</p>
<p>If you create a camera it will become the default instance so if you
need more than one you need to explicitly create them and it&#8217;s a good
idea to explicitly assign the one you want to each object.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I display an image exactly without anti-aliasing or smoothing
i.e. pixel perfect:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This can be done by using the 2d_flat shader and spcifying when the
Texture is loaded that mipmap=False. Because this is a global setting
it will be overwritten by whichever Texture is the last to be loaded</p>
