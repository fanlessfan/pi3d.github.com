<p>Is there a way of using memory more efficiently when using large

<div><p>There are two features added to the Texture class from v2.9 The first
allows &#8216;normal&#8217; CPU memory to be released after the GPU texture sampler
has been created: use the argument <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pi3d.Texture(free_after_load=True)</span></tt></p>
<p>The second feature allows more highly compressed texture formats to be
used for the GPU storage. The default is GL_RGB or GL_RGBA for jpg or
png style textures respectively which take three or four bytes. pi3d.GL_RGBA4,
pi3d.GL_RGB5_A1, pi3d.GL_RGB565 are alternatives that use only two bytes
and give quite acceptable colours for most things. Use for instance

To play around with the code you should either copy the whole

camera. Often this is because you are actually <strong>inside</strong> the object.</p>
<p>Try using the Camera.point_at([x,y,z]) function (see demos/ClashWalk.py
for use) or move and rotate the object and camera. Sprite and ImageSprite
shapes are one sided so cannot be seen from behind, try using a Plane
instead</p>
<p>Prior to v2.9 of pi3d there was a bug that stopped shapes with very large

<p>Alternatively, if it&#8217;s a shape you have generated such as
a Lathe or a Model, the normal vectors might be pointing in the wrong
direction. Try re-generating the shape, the path you use for the Lathe
needs to start at the top of the object and there are functions in
most 3D modeling applications to recalculate normals, or force them

<p>If you have a mouse combined with a keyboard (to save on USB slots) then
you might need to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_mouse_movements(1)</span></tt>. If you have problems

running <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">demos/TestEvents.py</span></tt> and changing the number in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_mouse_movements()</span></tt> a few times. It&#8217;s not clear what causes this
but it might be when the USB mouse is plugged in after the computer

<div class="section" id="optional-arguments">
<h2>Optional arguments<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-arguments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It appears from the demos that there are some arguments that are optional.
For example, can a Shape be drawn without specifying a shader and a texture?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are (almost too) many ways to set Shapes up to draw. The draw method
needs to have a <strong>Shader</strong>, a <strong>Light</strong> and a <strong>Camera</strong> specified but if
you neglect to create a Light and Camera when you first draw a Shape it
will generate &#8216;default instances&#8217; which most of the time are just what you
want. (These default instances can be accessed to change settings such as
color or direction for a Light or field of view for a Camera by using the
syntax: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Camera.instance()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>However the default instance of Shader is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mat_light</span></tt> which uses
the &#8216;self color&#8217; of the Shape (defaulting a neutral (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
as it would be messy to try to figure out if or what Textures to use.
Generally you choose the Shader to do the kind of rendering you want,
but you can feed that in by various means, many of which also cater
for specifying the Texture(s) to use at the same time:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For Model objects the ambient texture or material shade will normally
be defined in the 3D object file (egg or obj/mtl) In these cases
you could use:</p>

<div class="section" id="blending">
<h2>Blending<a class="headerlink" href="#blending" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How can I blend objects, why do objects vanish when they go behind a transparent
object and other questions to do with transparency (or apha property)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Transparency of Shapes can be altered by 1. the set_alpha() method 2. the
alpha value of pixels in a png type image file 3. alpha value of the fog.
The blending of the pixels with alpha less than 1.0 is controlled by setting
Texture.blend to True or False.</p>
<p>The way that transparency is handled is quite hard to understand. Here is
some good information <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Transparency_Sorting">http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Transparency_Sorting</a></p>
<p>The graphics processor has a global setting to enable blending that is
switched on or off as each Shape is drawn, allowing or preventing the pixels
to be blended with whatever&#8217;s behind them. In pi3d this can be controlled by
setting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blend=True</span></tt> argument when the Texture is created or at a later
point by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mytexture.blend</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">True</span></tt> In addition to this setting there is a check
in the draw() method so that blend is enabled when alpha is set to less than 1.0.</p>
<p>When the gpu is rendering an object there is a depth buffer that holds
information on how far from the camera each pixel has been drawn. Because
of this it is normally optimal to draw foreground objects first as there
is then less of the background to fill in. If the background was drawn
first then the same pixel might have to be redrawn several times as the
gpu found something else nearer to the view point. However the gpu
<strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong> take into account the transparency of the pixel when it&#8217;s
deciding if something is nearer or further away, so for blending
you have to draw things on top of other things...</p>
<p>Which sounds obvious but to give an example; if a slideshow tries to blend
between two images, one drawn in front of the other:</p>
<p>If you <strong>first</strong> draw the canvasFront (z=0.1) with alpha=0.1
<strong>then</strong> draw the canvasBack (z=0.2) with alpha=0.9 the result will
be a very faint image on canvasFront and nothing on canvasBack. Wrong!</p>
<p>i.e. canvasBack always has to be drawn first and if the application is purely
fading from one image to another it can leave canvasBack at apha=1.0 (i.e.
default value) and just increase then decrease the alpha of canvasFront</p>
<p>In addition to blending, when the Shader is rendering an object it discards
some pixels without drawing anything at all. The decision is based on the
alpha value of the pixel as read from the Texture. If blend is True then
pixels with alpha &lt; 0.05 are discarded if blend is False then pixels with
alpha &lt; 0.6 are discarded. This allows objects to be drawn after nearer objects
but still be seen through &#8216;holes&#8217; in the image. i.e. the trees in ForestWalk</p>

<h2>Making 3D models<a class="headerlink" href="#making-3d-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How do I make my own 3D model to load into pi3d?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You will need to &#8216;make&#8217; one on a bigger computer using 3D software such
as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blender</span></tt>. This falls outside the scope of this FAQ but your best
option is to export the model as an obj file. In Bl2.6 options I specify:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Apply Modifiers (default)
Include Edges (default)
Include Normals (tick this) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; *
Include UVs (default but see below)
Write Materials (default)
Object as OBJ Objects (default)

Forward -Z Forward (default)
Up Y Up (default)
these last two will mean that..
Blender.x=&gt;pi3d.x, Blender.y=&gt;pi3d.z, Blender.z=&gt;pi3d.y with no reflection
of whatever you design
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt> If you export without getting blender to Include Normals then pi3d
will have to generate them when the model is loaded. This is not a
good idea for several reasons: It will be slower to do on the pi then
on a &#8216;big&#8217; computer, it will have to be done every time the model is
loaded rather than just once, it will not give the fine control
available in blender to define the sharpness of edges.</p>
<p>NB You will need to define uv mapping even if you define a material
color and don&#8217;t intend to use a texture but might want to use a normal
mapping shader. To do this in blender you need to tab to edit mode, select
all vertices (a), unwrap (u, Unwrap). If the model has multiple objects
you will need to do this for each one. After you export you may need to
edit the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mtl</span></tt> file so the relative path to the image is correct for
their locations on the pi. In programs such as blender it is also possible to
use a more detailed (high polygon) model to create a &#8216;normal map&#8217; image
that can be used to give surface detail to the model in pi3d. Quite
technical but lots of instructional videos on youtube!</p>

<h3>How to use 2D images<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-use-2d-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Can I use pi3d for 2D images?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are various ways of doing this. The easiest way is to use the
image to texture a simple rectangle. The simplest shape to do this
is the Sprite which is also utilised by the ImageSprite shape to
allow the texture to be specified as it is created. The Plane object
is similar but is two sided. The advantage and disadvantage of this
method is that images will be different when viewed from different
locations.</p>
<p>If you specify an orthogrphic camera (set the argument
is_3d=False) then there will be no perspective (the image will not
get smaller as it moves away from the camera) and each unit of the
dimensions of the object will be one pixel on the screen. With both
these methods the shape can be rotated, moved and scaled in all
dimensions.</p>
<p>You can also use the shader 2d_flat which takes pixels from an image
and maps them to the screen, see below. The advantage of this
method is that it can use the even simpler Canvas object and it always
stays in the same place relative to the camera so you only need one
camera, which can be the default one that you don&#8217;t have to bother
creating. See below.</p>
<p>From v1.14 the Buffer.re_init() method (see below under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Is</span> <span class="pre">it</span>
<span class="pre">possible</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">change</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">shape...</span></tt>) allows vertices to be moved
around quite easily. These vertices can be rendered as points and
the Shader can be made to draw an image or part of an image at each
point. This technique allows much larger numbers of sprites to be
drawn per frame, especially if the fast array processing power of
numpy is used as well. See the demos <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SpriteBalls.py</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SpriteMulti.py</span></tt></p>

<h3>nearness of 2D relative to 3D<a class="headerlink" href="#nearness-of-2d-relative-to-3d" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>How do I display 2D images in front of a 3D scene? (or behind, for that
matter)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Either draw them onto a Canvas object using the 2d_flat shader or
create two cameras one 3D and one 2D and assign the relevant camera
to the types of objects you want to be drawn by each method. You
can move the 3D camera around the scene but leave the 2D one stationary,
that way you won&#8217;t have to keep moving and rotating the 2D objects
to keep them in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Orthographic (2D) cameras will render objects with a z value that is
severely non linear and does not relate in a simple way to the z values
for the perspective camera. Generally 2D objects will be in front
of objects rendered by perspective (3D) cameras unless you assign
z values in the thousands. Too large a z value (&gt; 10000), though, and
they will disappear beyond the &#8216;far plane&#8217;. If z_o is the z value of a
Shape viewed with an orthographic camera and z_p is the z value of a Shape
viewed with a perspective camera then their relative distances during
rendering by the Shader (i.e. which obscures the other) follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">z_p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10000</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10000</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">z_o</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># so z_o of 9000 gives z_p of 10</span>

<p>If you create a camera it will become the default instance so if you

<div><p>This is because of the order of the transformations done prior to

To see what I mean watch the behaviour of the tanks in demos/TigerTank.py
You have to figure out the &#8216;slope of the ground&#8217; so that when your
aeroplane (or boat) is rotated it ends up with the correct pitch and
roll. For a shape with zero pitch you can use something like:</p>

This issue seems to be fixed but if you run into memory problems
it might be worth trying this. Plus, obviously, report it to us!)</p>
<p>The alternative (faster, better) way of doing it is to use the Buffer.re_init()
method which takes arguments to set new values for pts (i.e. vertices),
texcoords and normals. These are passed as lists of xyz or uv lists or tuples

unif[50] = 0.0 you can then access these values as uniform
variables in your shader as vec3 unif[16][0] unfi[16][1]
unfi[16][2]. If the array indices are contiguous you could do the
same thing using PostProcess.sprite.set_custom_data(48, [1.1414,
2013, 0.0]) or even PostProcess.sprite.unif[48] = 1.1414 etc</p>
<p>I see no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t do something like:
render the scene to a texture once a second draw it off-screen using
a shader to extract edges as dayglo on white, blur them to a second
texture, draw this onto a foreground sprite fading from alpha 0 to
1 back to 0 over 1s cycle. Use a different shader to draw the original
texture onto a spherical surface that gradually changes shape in
the background. etc etc.</p>

<p>In order to get the pixels &#8216;out of&#8217; the GPU memory into CPU space, the only way
I have found is to do something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>import numpy as np
import ctypes
...
ntex = np.zeros((post.iy, post.ix, 4), dtype=np.uint8) # make an empty array of the correct size
...
  # inside the drawing loop. If you are offscreen rendering then you need to do this
  #  BEFORE you switch back to the normal view with end_capture
  pi3d.opengles.glReadPixels(0, 0, post.ix, post.iy, pi3d.GL_RGBA, pi3d.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,
                                ntex.ctypes.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_short)))
</pre></div>

<p>But glReadPixels is relatively slow compared with rendering to and
then drawing with a renderbuffer object so don&#8217;t expect a fantastic framerate.</p>

<h3>python v. shader unif arrays<a class="headerlink" href="#python-v-shader-unif-arrays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>And why does python set Shape.unif[48] but the shader use
vec3 unif[16][0].</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>On the shader side it&#8217;s really efficient to define variables as
vec3, vec4, mat4 etc. and at one stage I tried doing a lot of the
matrix manipulation in the vertex shader. There were pros and
cons but in the end I found that using python&#8217;s numpy library
was the best bet. But in the mean time I had started storing
much of the shape information in a form that allowed it to be
accessible by the shader i.e. location x,y,z was vec3 unif[0]
in the shader, rotation was vec3 unif[1], scale unif[2], origin
offset unif[3] etc. Although I no longer needed these for normal
rendering I thought that they may come in useful for someone at
some stage so I just left them. I only needed to pass one array
pionter so there was no cost to having 60 floats available!</p>
<p>Meanwhile back in the python description of the Shape I had to
make the unif array a ctypes.c_float array and that seemed to
have to be one-dimensional. So after a long story unif[16][0]
in the shader is (same name but different) unif[16*3 + 0] in python</p>

<h2>Blend shaders<a class="headerlink" href="#blend-shaders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How do the blend shaders work as used in the PictureFrame
demo</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>These shaders are based on the 2d_flat shader (as mentioned above)
that uses the screen coordinates of each pixel, rather than the
interpolated coordinates of 3D polygon uv values, to look up the
color values. The main differences from 2d_flat are 1. There are
two textures passed to the shader 2. There are two sets of x, y, w,
h and screen height values passed to the shaders (one for each texture)
3. There is a time value passed to the shader varying from 0.0 to 1.0
to control the proportion of blending 4. There is a blending function!</p>
<p>If you look at the code for blend_bump.vs (and the other blend vertex
shaders) you will see that it calculates two vec2 varying values that
are passed to the fragment shader. The sole reason for doing this is
relative expense of dividing by a variable compared with multiplication
in the fragment shader. The values are used to scale the pixel locations
to texture lookup locations.</p>
<p>All of the fragment shaders then operate in a fairly similar way: pick
up the fading factor (tm = unif[14][2]), define coord as the pixel
location on the screen, for the foreground and background textures
check if the pixel falls outside the texture, if it doesn&#8217;t then look
up the RGBA value from the texture.</p>
<p>Having got the foreground and background pixel values there is then
a process of combining them which generally involves calculating a
factor dependent on some or all of a) pixel values b) x,y location
on the screen c) tm. Using the factor in a mix() function.</p>

The pi3d.Lines class does this for you.</p>

<div><p>pi3d relies on some of the functionality and speed of numpy and this
only really became useable as of pypy-2.2 and I have managed to get
pi3d working to some extent with that. At the moment that isn&#8217;t the
current version you get with apt-get so these were the steps I took:</p>
<p>1. download the relevant version from <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/download.html">http://pypy.org/download.html</a>
for your machine (Ubuntu, raspbian etc) extract it into a new directory
i.e. /home/me/pypy-2.2.1-linux64</p>
<p>2. in a
terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>sudo apt-get install pypy-dev
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>3. download and install pypy-numpy so it&#8217;s also in a subdirectory
of pypy-x.x.x-etc I did this cd to that directory then using:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy.git
cd numpy
sudo ../bin/pypy setup.py install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>4.* download Pillow from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow</a> and
extract it into its own subdirectory of pypy-x.x.x-etc i.e.
/home/me/pypy-2.2.1-linux64/Pillow-2.2.1</p>
<p>5.* download <a class="reference external" href="http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py">http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py</a> to
pypy-x.x.x-etc/bin and run it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>sudo ./pypy distribute_setup.py
</pre></div>

<p>6.* either cd to pypy-x.x.x-etc/bin
and run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>sudo ./easy_install Pillow
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>7.* or cd to the Pillow-x.x directory
and run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>sudo ../bin/pypy setup.py install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I did different permutations of these things but confused myself as
to which I was &#8216;really&#8217; doing (by occasionally forgetting to type
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">./pypy</span></tt> and thereby running a debian package version that was
also installed) so some of these steps are redundant. Also other
steps may be missing.</p>
<p>At the moment (Dec13

the changes to Shape.draw() have been commented out because they
look to add some extra processing at an expensive location. If
you want to try pypy you will have to swap the two lines (search
for pypy to find them)</p>

<h3>Cube<a class="headerlink" href="#cube" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>How can I make my own EnvironmentCube images using pictures of my
garden or school playground?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Option 1. Using an EnvironmentCube (as the question says) but see
below for using a Sphere, which is probably easier.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways of doing this and different software as well
as special cameras. However this is the method I have followed using
freely available software: gimp and blender (running on a &#8216;normal&#8217;
computer rather than the pi at this stage).</p>
<p>The first half of the job is to get a set of images into a &#8216;seamless&#8217;
band. Obviously you need to have taken a set of pictures that overlap
25% to 50%. In gimp make a new image that is higher and wider than
you will need to paste all the images side by side. You will need to
have the same image repeated at the left end and the right end.</p>
<p>Open each image in gimp then copy it, go to the new &#8216;wide strip&#8217;
image and paste as new layer. Use the four headed arrow to position
each layer so it &#8216;joins up&#8217;. When you put the duplicate left most
image at the right end you need to make sure that it is at exactly
the same vertical position as it is on the left.</p>
<p>Working down from the top layer add layer masks (default white, full
opacity) then using gradient fill tool make the mask fade from
transparent to opaque across the overlapping portion. You might need
to slightly rotate some images to make them join up nicely from one
side to the other.</p>
<p>When it looks perfect (!) merge the layers down then crop the image
so there are no gaps at the top and bottom and so the left and right
edges join seamlessly. You will probably have to zoom to maximum and
choose an easily identifiable pixel. The rectangular selection tool
in gimp allows the edges to be dragged to fine tune it. Export the
image to jpg or png possibly after reducing to a reasonable size. Have
some suitable sky only image to patch into the top of the sphere you
will create in blender...</p>
<p>I used blender 2.69, it&#8217;s not a trivial application if you&#8217;ve not used
it before and it might take a bit of effort to figure out what I&#8217;m
referring to [tab] means tab key, otherwise it&#8217;s probably a menu
item or an icon in the right hand. Lots of youtube videos to look at.
In blender:</p>
<p>1. [del] delete the
startup cube</p>
<p>2. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Add</span> <span class="pre">Mesh</span> <span class="pre">UV</span> <span class="pre">Sphere</span></tt>, on left tools
set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shading</span> <span class="pre">Smooth</span></tt></p>
<p>3. [s] to scale up
to about 10x</p>
<p>4. [tab] to edit mode [a] to deselect all vertices. R-click on top
vertex the Ctrl-numpad+ to select vertices down to about 45 degrees
north (or use [b] and box select) [del] delete vertices. You should
now have a sphere with the top cut off</p>
<p>5. [tab] back to object mode then create another sphere at the same
location but scale it up very slightly bigger and chop off the bottom
but so they overlap just a little.</p>
<p>6. [tab] back to object mode then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Add</span> <span class="pre">Empty</span> <span class="pre">Cube</span></tt> at the same location
(NB if you accidentally left click on the view window you will move
the starting point marker where new things appear). You should be able
to zoom in with the mouse wheel and see this cube inside the spheres.</p>
<p>7. still in object mode right click to select the bottom (inner and larger)
sphere. The edge should go yellow to indicate it&#8217;s been selected.</p>
<p>8. on the right properties window click the Materials icon (CofG circle
4th from right), then + new.</p>
<p>9. then click the Textures icon (red/white check 3rd from right),
then + new, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Type</span> <span class="pre">Image</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">movie</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Image</span> <span class="pre">New</span></tt> browse to the wide horizon
image you made, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Mapping</span> <span class="pre">Projection</span> <span class="pre">Tube</span></tt></p>
<p>10. still in object mode right click on the top sphere, add material and
texture exactly as for the bottom sphere but select the patch of sky
image mentioned above and choose <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Mapping</span> <span class="pre">Projection</span> <span class="pre">Flat</span></tt></p>
<p>11. in object mode right click on the Empty Cube and add a new Texture (you
should see a reduced list of options so it&#8217;s 2nd from right in the list)</p>
<p>12. select under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Type</span> <span class="pre">Environment</span> <span class="pre">Map</span></tt> then under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Environment</span> <span class="pre">Map</span> <span class="pre">Static</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Mapping</span> <span class="pre">Cube</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Viewpoint</span> <span class="pre">Object</span>&nbsp; <span class="pre">Empty</span></tt></p>
<p>13. in the properties icons select render (camera left most) then under
Render press the render button. This should flash up a series of six
smaller images then go black!</p>
<p>14. re-select the Texture icon (all of these steps should have the Empty
Cube as the selected object) and the little down arrow under Environment
Map should produce a drop-down menu with an option to save the image.</p>
<p>The texture can then be used in pi3d with EnvironmentMap type BLENDER. However
there will be a sharp line where the edge of the bottom sphere fell. You can
smooth this out using clone, repair, blur and blend tools in gimp; be
careful not to blur the boundaries between the six images.</p>

that can be used to draw the texture. There are filters that can
produce effects such as blurring, outlining and normal map generation.</div></blockquote>

<h2>Texture animation<a class="headerlink" href="#texture-animation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Is it possible to change a texture every frame at a reasonable frame
rate? i.e. for displaying a video, a feed from a web cam or an
image manipulation program such as OpenCV, Scipy or numpy?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This became much more feasible after v1.4 and more so after v2.1
The Texture class now accepts a numpy array (size (H,W,N) where N
is 3 for RGB or 4 for RGBA), remember C arrays are row,col,pixel)</p>
<p>There is also a method Texture.update_ndarray(new_array) that can
efficiently switch the image to the new array. See the demo
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">VideoWalk.py</span></tt> which maps a movie onto a shape using ffmpeg.</p>

<h2>Profiling<a class="headerlink" href="#profiling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How to profile code to find where the bottlenecks are? For example
to find if it&#8217;s worth doing something complicated with numpy or &#8216;blitting&#8217;
small areas of the screen as in the NumpyBalls demo?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The python profiler cProfile is very easy to use but I have found
it struggles to find directories from the code and gives quirky
information unless I do something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd ~/pi3d_demos
$ python -m cProfile ~/pi3d_demos/NumpyBalls.py &gt; result.txt

<h2>Desktop or laptop<a class="headerlink" href="#desktop-or-laptop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Is it possible to use pi3d on my laptop or desktop computer
ideally running windows?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If your computer has a suitable graphics card then you should be
able to do this.</p>
<p><strong>windows</strong> requires a version of pi3d v2.0 or later see <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com/html/ReadMe.html#windows">ReadMe Windows</a></p>
<p><strong>linux</strong> is more similar to the Raspberry Pi, also see <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com/html/ReadMe.html#setup-on-desktop-and-laptop-machines">ReadMe Linux</a></p>
<p><strong>mac</strong> ought to be possible following a very similar procedure to
linux but I havn&#8217;t tried (let me know if you do!)</p>
<p>On windows or mac it is also possible to use something like VMWare:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Setup:

VMWare Client
3d Accel.. activated!
LinuxMint Installation (Ubundu-based and Debian base version works)

very important
    mesa-utils-extra
    python-numpy
and the rest as described in the Pi3D documentation

Important: pi3d scripts must be started with sudo

e.g. sudo python ./Pi3D2.py

In the VM it does not run very smooth, but it works without errors.

After testing this setup  I&#39;ve installed the setup to a partition... runs like a charm :-)

<p>Is is possible to run pi3d on my Android phone or tablet which uses

<blockquote>
<div>Is is possible; but you have to compile an apk package using
python-for-android from a linux machine. There are instructions here
