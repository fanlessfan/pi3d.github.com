<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">I installed using pistore but when I run it all I get is a spinning globe!
How do I get it to do anything else?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Tim Skillman, the original developer, set up the pistore demos as a
kind of taster. However there are serious deficiencies in the way
pistore hides away all the complexities; pi3d is, after all, a module
for helping you to program in python.</p>
<p>The first issue you will have already suffered: the pistore installation
is quite long winded. The second issue is that the installation is in
a relatively obscure location /usr/local/indiecity/InstalledApps/pi3d/Full...
but it&#8217;s a good idea to find the actual location of the demos:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>sudo find / -name 'Amazing.py'</pre>
</div>
<p>Now you know where they are you can <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com/html/index.html">ReadMe</a> to see how to run and
edit the demos. The third issue is that pi3d has moved on almost
unrecognisably since the version put up on pistore. Ideally Tim would
be keeping it up to date, but in the absence of that, I would strongly
recommend anyone who finds they have an interest in actually using
pi3d to unistall the pistore version then:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>sudo apt-get install git
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/tipam/pi3d.git</pre>
</div>
<p>This will give you the option to update your version with bug-fixes
and improvements by simply:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>cd ~/pi3d
git pull origin master</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">My RPi Crashes or reboots when I try and run a demo.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Any program using a loadable texture, which includes nearly all the demos,
requires the Python Imaging module (PIL). Additionally, some demos require tk.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com/html/index.html">ReadMe</a> for information on how to install these packages.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I see nothing but a white screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Possibly something has gone wrong with an opengles function, sometimes
there might be an error message in the terminal such as failed to create
display. This could be caused by running out of gpu memory (see <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com/html/index.html">ReadMe</a>
for how to set up memory split).</p>
<p>Occasionally multi-threaded applications can cause this problem if an
opengles function call is made not from the main thread.  If you encounter
this, please contact the pi3d team so we can protect against this in
future.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I see nothing but a black screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Possibly something has gone wrong in a shader, such as using a shader
requiring texture coords (i.e. mat_relfect) on a Model exported with
no uv mapping.</p>
<p>There may be a line number reference output by the shader compiler in the
terminal window.  It is great fun experimenting with shaders but they are
<em>?£#%</em> taciturn beasts to debug! The problem could be caused by sending
some bad render setting to a shader.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I see nothing but the background.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You will need to set background to non-transparent and a color not equal
to black or white to determine if this is happening.</p>
<p>Either the shape is behind the camera, too far away, is outside the field
of view, is too small, too large or the polygons are facing away from the
camera. Often this is because you are actually <strong>inside</strong> the object.</p>
<p>Try using the Camera.point_at([x,y,z]) function (see demos/ClashWalk.py
for use) or move and rotate the object and camera. Sprite and ImageSprite
shapes are one sided so cannot be seen from behind, try using a Plane
instead</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I see only black silhouettes against the background.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You may be trying to use a shader that requires light but there isn&#8217;t
any, or it&#8217;s turned down too low. Try switching to a &#8216;flat&#8217; shader
to check.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if it&#8217;s a shape you have generated such as
a Lathe or a Model, the normal vectors might be pointing in the wrong
direction. Try re-generating the shape, the path you use for the Lathe
needs to start at the top of the object and there are functions in
most 3D modeling applications to recalculate normals, or force them
to point outwards.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The demo loads but the mouse doesn&#8217;t move the camera as it&#8217;s supposed to.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If this only happens on demos using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">event</span></tt> library (such as Silo.py)
then it could be the hardware configuration is pretending to be something
it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not uncommon for keyboards to say they are mice or
joysticks.</p>
<p>If you have a mouse combined with a keyboard (to save on USB slots) then
you might need to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_mouse_movements(1)</span></tt>. If you have problems
with a device or inputs using the event system it&#8217;s a good idea to run
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">FindDevices.py</span></tt> from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pi3d/event/</span></tt> - this will give you lots
of additional information.</p>
<p>There is also an application <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">demos/TestEvents.py</span></tt> that you can run to
find what information is being returned by your input devices. In some
circumstances you might need to modify the values returned by the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pi3d/event/Event.py</span> <span class="pre">InputEvents</span></tt> methods. TODO at the moment this
involves hacking the file but it will use a lookup table.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It appears from the demos that there are some arguments that are optional.
For example, can a Shape be drawn without specifying a shader and a texture?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are (almost too) many ways to set Shapes up to draw. The draw method
needs to have a <strong>Shader</strong>, a <strong>Light</strong> and a <strong>Camera</strong> specified but if
you neglect to create a Light and Camera when you first draw a Shape it
will generate &#8216;default instances&#8217; which most of the time are just what you
want. (These default instances can be accessed to change settings such as
color or direction for a Light or field of view for a Camera by using the
syntax: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Camera.instance()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>You do, however need to explicitly
create the Shader so it does the kind of rendering you want, but you
can feed that in by various means, many of which also cater for specifying
the Texture(s) to use as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Set them directly in the Buffer array - the other methods are
really just wrappers for this i.e.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">myshape</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">myshader</span>
<span class="n">myshape</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">textures</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">mytexture</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Include them
at draw time:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">myshape</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myshader</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">mytexture</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Set them beforehand
(probably the most usual way):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">myshape</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_draw_details</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myshader</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">mytexture</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For Model objects the ambient tecdxture or material shade will normally
be defined in the 3D object file (egg or obj/mtl) In these cases
you could use:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>myshape.set_shader(myshader)
...
myshape.set_normal_shine(normtex, ntiles..) # leaves the first texture if there
...
myshape.set_material(mtrl)</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How can I blend objects, why do objects vanish when they go behind a transparent
object and other questions to do with transparency (or apha property)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Transparency of Shapes can be altered by 1. the set_alpha() method 2. the
alpha value of pixels in a png type image file 3. alpha value of the fog.
The blending of the pixels with alpha less than 1.0 is controlled by setting
Texture.blend to True or False.</p>
<p>The way that transparency is handled is quite hard to understand. Here is
some good information <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Transparency_Sorting">http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Transparency_Sorting</a></p>
<p>The graphics processor has a global setting to enable blending that is
switched on or off as each Shape is drawn, allowing or preventing the pixels
to be blended with whatever&#8217;s behind them. In pi3d this can be controlled by
setting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blend=True</span></tt> argument when the Texture is created or at a later
point by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mytexture.blend</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">True</span></tt> In addition to this setting there is a check
in the draw() method so that blend is enabled when alpha is set to less than 1.0.</p>
<p>When the gpu is rendering an object there is a depth buffer that holds
information on how far from the camera each pixel has been drawn. Because
of this it is normally optimal to draw foreground objects first as there
is then less of the background to fill in. If the background was drawn
first then the same pixel might have to be redrawn several times as the
gpu found something else nearer to the view point. However the gpu
<strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong> take into account the transparency of the pixel when it&#8217;s
deciding if something is nearer or further away, so for blending
you have to draw things on top of other things...</p>
<p>Which sounds obvious but to give an example; if a slideshow tries to blend
between two images, one drawn in front of the other:</p>
<p>If you <strong>first</strong> draw the canvasFront (z=0.1) with alpha=0.1
<strong>then</strong> draw the canvasBack (z=0.2) with alpha=0.9 the result will
be a very faint image on canvasFront and nothing on canvasBack. Wrong!</p>
<p>i.e. canvasBack always has to be drawn first and if the application is purely
fading from one image to another it can leave canvasBack at apha=1.0 (i.e.
default value) and just increase then decrease the alpha of canvasFront</p>
<p>In addition to blending, when the Shader is rendering an object it discards
some pixels without drawing anything at all. The decision is based on the
alpha value of the pixel as read from the Texture. If blend is True then
pixels with alpha &lt; 0.05 are discarded if blend is False then pixels with
alpha &lt; 0.6 are discarded. This allows objects to be drawn after nearer objects
but still be seen through &#8216;holes&#8217; in the image. i.e. the trees in ForestWalk</p>

<li><p class="first">How do I use a joystick, gamepad, xbox controller etc with a pi3d
application?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Often these will just work with the event module when plugged into the USB,
sometimes you may need to use a different InputEvents method, for instance
with an xbox 360 you get the left joystick from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_joystickB3d()</span></tt>
Also you would need to install the driver and start it running first:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>sudo apt-get install xboxdrv
sudo xboxdrv -s -i 0</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I make my own 3D model to load into pi3d?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You will need to &#8216;make&#8217; one on a bigger computer using 3D software such
as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blender</span></tt>. This falls outside the scope of this FAQ but your best
option is to export the model as an obj file. In Bl2.6 options I specify:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Apply Modifiers (default)
Include Edges (default)
Include Normals (tick this) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; *
Include UVs (default but see below)
Write Materials (default)
Object as OBJ Objects (default)

Forward -Z Forward (default)
Up Y Up (default)
these last two will mean that..
Blender.x=&gt;pi3d.x, Blender.y=&gt;pi3d.z, Blender.z=&gt;pi3d.y with no reflection
of whatever you design</pre>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you export without getting blender to Include Normals then pi3d</li>
</ul>
<p>will have to generate them when the model is loaded. This is not a
good idea for several reasons: It will be slower to do on the pi then
on a &#8216;big&#8217; computer, it will have to be done every time the model is
loaded rather than just once, it will not give the fine control
available in blender to define the sharpness of edges.</p>
<p>NB You will need to define uv mapping even if you define a material
colour and don&#8217;t intend to use a texture but might want to use a normal
mapping shader. To do this in blender you need to tab to edit mode, select
all vertices (a), unwrap (u, Unwrap). If the model has multiple objects
you will need to do this for each one. After you export you may need to
edit the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mtl</span></tt> file so the relative path to the image is correct for
their locations on the pi. In programs such as blender it is also possible to
use a more detailed (high polygon) model to create a &#8216;normal map&#8217; image
that can be used to give surface detail to the model in pi3d. Quite
technical but lots of instructional videos on youtube!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I get error messages trying to install from PiStore?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There was an issue with the early versions of PiStore which should
be fixed if you update it. If you continue to have problems and you
are somehow able to read this FAQ somewhere else you should be able
to download a zipped file from <a class="reference external" href="http://pi3d.github.com">http://pi3d.github.com</a> There is also
documentation and installation instructions on that webiste. Or almost
as easy install git and use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clone</span> <span class="pre">https://github.com/tipam/pi3d.git</span></tt>
this will give you the opportunity to upgrade in the future with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span> <span class="pre">origin</span> <span class="pre">master</span></tt></p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Can I use pi3d for 2D images?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are various ways of doing this. The easiest way is to use the
image to texture a simple rectangle. The simplest shape to do this
is the Sprite which is also utilised by the ImageSprite shape to
allow the texture to be specified as it is created. The Plane object
is similar but is two sided. The advantage and disadvantage of this
method is that images will be different when viewed from different
locations.</p>
<p>If you specify an orthogrphic camera (set the argument
is_3d=False) then there will be no perspective (the image will not
get smaller as it moves away from the camera) and each unit of the
dimensions of the object will be one pixel on the screen. With both
these methods the shape can be rotated, moved and scaled in all
dimensions.</p>
<p>You can also use the shader 2d_flat which takes pixels from an image
and maps them to the screen, see below. The advantage of this
method is that it can use the even simpler Canvas object and it always
stays in the same place relative to the camera so you only need one
camera, which can be the default one that you don&#8217;t have to bother
creating. See below.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I display 2D images in front of a 3D scene? (or behind, for that
matter)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Either draw them onto a Canvas object using the 2d_flat shader or
create two cameras one 3D and one 2D and assign the relevant camera
to the types of objects you want to be drawn by each method. You
can move the 3D camera around the scene but leave the 2D one stationary,
that way you won&#8217;t have to keep moving and rotating the 2D objects
to keep them in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Orthographic (2D) cameras will render objects with a z value that is
severely non linear and does not relate in a simple way to the z values
for the perspective camera. Generally 2D objects will be in front
of objects rendered by perspective (3D) cameras unless you assign
z values in the thousands. Too large a z value, though, and they will
disappear beyond the &#8216;far plane&#8217;</p>
<p>If you create a camera it will become the default instance so if you
need more than one you need to explicitly create them and it&#8217;s a good
idea to explicitly assign the one you want to each object.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I display an image exactly without anti-aliasing or smoothing
i.e. pixel perfect?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This can be done by using the 2d_flat shader and spcifying when the
Texture is loaded that mipmap=False. Because this is a global setting
it will be overwritten by whichever Texture is the last to be loaded</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When the demos start there is sometimes a message in the terminal
looking like:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2013-08-19</span> <span class="pre">15:36:46,232</span> <span class="pre">INFO:</span> <span class="pre">__main__:</span> <span class="pre">Starting</span> <span class="pre">CollisionBalls</span></tt>
Where does that come from and what does it mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Log module is started by several of the basic classes (Buffer,
EventStream, Display, Loadable, Mouse, parse_mtl, Shader, Screenshot)
This means that all programs using the pi3d modules will create a Log
as a by-product. It can be used for debugging and recording errors.</p>

<li><p class="first">How do I use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pi3d.Log</span></tt> to gather or display useful information

</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How do I keep two components (Shapes) &#8216;joined together&#8217; as they pitch, roll
and rotate (yaw), like the TigerTank does with its body, turret and gun?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>First of all it is easiest if you make the zero points of all the shapes
coincide. When you move and rotate the objects you must move and rotate
them all by the same amount. If one component is rotated about the y axis
by a different amount from the others (i.e. the turret and gun) then
the difference is just added to the y rotation for that component.
However if the component is rotated about the y axis and the x axis
(i.e. the gun) then you have to adjust the x axis and the z axis rotation
by an amount that depends on the degree of y axis rotation. See the
drawTiger function in demos/TigerTank.py for the kind of formula to use.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I want to give my shape an angle of bank (z-axis rotation) which it
maintains as it turns (y-axis rotation) - like an aeroplane. However the
z-rotation is always relative to the absolute frame of reference so the shape
pitches backwards and forwards as it turns. How do I make the frame of
reference rotate with the shape?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is because of the order of the transformations done prior to
redrawing the scene (z, then x, then y). You have to work out what the pitch
and roll would have to be prior to rotating them about their own y axis!
To see what I mean watch the behaviour of the tanks in demos/TigerTank.py
You have to figure out the &#8216;slope of the ground&#8217; so that when your
aeroplane (or boat) is rotated it ends up with the correct pitch and
roll. For a shape with zero pitch you can use something like:</p>

</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Is it possible to change the shape of an object once it&#8217;s been made?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The most efficient way is to use the scale(sx, sy, sz) method. However,
this obviously limits the shape changing that can take place. If the
shape needs to be changed more than this then it can be remade as
a new instance to replace the old one. (At one stage it was necessary to
clear the previous opengles buffers using the unload_opengl() method
before destroying the old shape to stop a graphics memory leak.
This issue seems to be fixed but if you run into memory problems
it might be worth trying this. Plus, obviously, report it to us!)</p>
<p>The alternative way of doing it is to use the Buffer.re_init() method
which takes the same arguments as Buffer.__init__() (see documentation)
so is a little more technical to use.</p>

<li><p class="first">How do I do post-rendering processing on a scene, such as blurring,
edge detection or fancier effects such as oil painting.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There is a class PostProcess that can be used to render a scene to
a texture. The Post.py demo shows a simple 3x3 convolution matrix
shader and there are a host of post process filter shaders that
are in the pi3d_demos/shaders directory. These wll be loaded in
turn by FilterDemo.py but the pi will run out of graphics memory
if you leave the full list in. For more complicated effects it&#8217;s
over to you!</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">OK the example for post processing (Post.py) is quite hard to follow
how exactly does the PostProcess class work.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PostProcess inherits from Texture (via OffScreenTexture) so you can
use an instance of it anywhere you would use a texture, i.e. you
could uv map it onto any other shape or use it as a bump or
reflection map. Or use it with your own shader to do something I
haven&#8217;t thought of. PostProcess.sprite is a Sprite shape that can
be used just as any other Shape in your program, you could rotate
it or change its alpha value or z location to draw it in front of
other objects. There is also a 2D camera created in PostProcess
which is used to draw the sprite at full screen using the saved
texture and the shader you supply in the constructor or post_base
if you don&#8217;t supply one.</p>
<p>PostProcess.draw({48:1.1414, 49:2013, 50:0.0}) will set the unif
array in PostProcess.sprite as unif[48] = 1.1414 unif[49] = 2013
unif[50] = 0.0 you can then access these values as uniform
variables in your shader as vec3 unif[16][0] unfi[16][1]
unfi[16][2]. If the array indices are contiguous you could do the
same thing using PostProcess.sprite.set_custom_data(48, [1.1414,
2013, 0.0]) or even PostProcess.sprite.unif[48] = 1.1414 etc</p>
<p>I see no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t do something like:
render the scene to a texture once a second draw it off-screen using
a shader to extract edges as dayglo on white, blur them to a second
texture, draw this onto a foreground sprite fading from alpha 0 to
1 back to 0 over 1s cycle. Use a different shader to draw the original
texture onto a spherical surface that gradually changes shape in
the background. etc etc.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">And why does python set Shape.unif[48] but the shader use
vec3 unif[16][0].</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>On the shader side it&#8217;s really efficient to define variables as
vec3, vec4, mat4 etc. and at one stage I tried doing a lot of the
matrix manipulation in the vertex shader. There were pros and
cons but in the end I found that using python&#8217;s numpy library
was the best bet. But in the mean time I had started storing
much of the shape information in a form that allowed it to be
accessible by the shader i.e. location x,y,z was vec3 unif[0]
in the shader, rotation was vec3 unif[1], scale unif[2], origin
offset unif[3] etc. Although I no longer needed these for normal
rendering I thought that they may come in useful for someone at
some stage so I just left them. I only needed to pass one array
pionter so there was no cost to having 60 floats available!</p>
<p>Meanwhile back in the python description of the Shape I had to
make the unif array a ctypes.c_float array and that seemed to
have to be one-dimensional. So after a long story unif[16][0]
in the shader is (same name but different) unif[16*3 + 0] in python</p>

<li><p class="first">How can you render points like a star field
or sparks from an explosion.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you use the method set_point_size() on a Shape to a value other
than 0.0 then the vertices of the Shape will be rendered as points.
The size will actually vary with distance but will be the size you
specified at 1 unit of distance from the camera.</p>
<p>pi3d.Points can be used to render points using the mat_flat shader</p>
